# mywork
help me plan backlog of work activities across a number of projects and needs.

Business need is to set p a way to maage my "yellow stickies" those magical notes taking things I have across my desk - taht each have a "need" identified. 

Needs can be
- project specific
- role specific (advisor, PM, leadership, mentor)

Needs should have 
- name
- date
- basic description
- priority (do i need to get it done today 1, or later this week 2)

Optional - are they blocked by something, more details

realy a way for me to manage my work
